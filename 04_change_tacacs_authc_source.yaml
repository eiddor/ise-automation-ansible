# 04_change_tacacs_authc_source.yaml
#
# This file will simply change the identity source of the default device administration policy to use
# internal users instead of all user stores
#
# It's not strictly necessary to do this, but it can sometimes speed up authc for a lab environment
# that isn't talking to an AD or LDAP for device administrator user information.
#
# This was also the second most annoying playbook to develop because there are two settings that we need
# from ISE (policy id and rule id) in order to change the setting.  ISE's API also required a bunch of
# seemingly random fields to be sent all so we can set this: identitySourceName: "Internal Users"
#

# Read in some variables
