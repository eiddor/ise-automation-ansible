# 08_create_authorization_profiles.yaml
#
# This file will create authorization profiles for wired and wireless network access users.
# The reason we need to have separate tasks for wired and wireless is because Cisco WLCs
# accept a different RADIUS attribute for VLAN assignments than Cisco switches.  Please don't ask me why.
#
# All data for the profiles (names and VLANs) is pulled from the policy.yaml file and then there will be
# a wired and wireless profile created for each.
#
# I'm using a different way to wrap strings around a variable in the description field below
# because apparently the way I've been doing it is some old way and Google failed me
#
# You should not have to edit this file unless you want to add more fields or customize further.

# Cisco WLCs (both IOS-XE and AireOS) do not accept the same VLAN RADIUS attribute that we used in the task above,
# so we have to pass "Airespace-Interface-Name" with the VLAN name instead. Otherweise this task is the same.
