# 06_create-sgts.yaml
#
# This file will create Scalable Group Tags (SGTs) in ISE that can be used for policy
# with Cisco Software-Defined Access.
#
# In an average SD-Access environment these SGTs would be created with Cisco DNA Center, so this
# playbook isn't strictly necessary, however these SGTs need to exist before the authorization policies
# are created.
#
# Either way, you should not need to modify this file - You should list your SGTs in policy.yaml
#
- hosts: ise_servers
# Read in some variables
  vars_files:
    - credentials.yaml  # read the ISE host and admin credentials
    - policy.yaml  # read in policy settings (SGTs for this playbook)
